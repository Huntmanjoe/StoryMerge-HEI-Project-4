# StoryMerge

StoryMerge is a site where writers can come to share their ideas as prompts, start new stories by responding to prompts, or continue someone else's story! Stories are structured as trees with multiple responses - if you love the 100 entry epic but think you could do better if you started writing from entry 50, go ahead! This project was made by Hunter Matyi, Eve Strittmatter, and Ikram Chouichi during the Flatiron School software engineering course.
